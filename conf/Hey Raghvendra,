Hey Raghvendra,

I appreciate you sharing this experience with everyone and I agree about what you say. But it is wrong of you to point out the class and batch to make an online trial of those students. I'm a student of the wednesday 275 batch and I know the girl you are talking about. If your intention was to just share this experience and not indirectly point out those students, you should not have narrowed down to the class and batch. I'm objecting because we had a similar situation but we made all the arrangements and sorted things out with mutual consent. Now because of your post, few people are asking us if this post is pointed to us. They don't know what happened between our project mates. That is our business to deal with which we dealt with professionally. Please use your wit before posting things online in excitement/rage.

From what you say, it is wrong of the people to remove someone just for this reason. But no one knows what exactly is going on in between them. We are no one here to read a one-sided thread and judge those people. If there is a problem, take your friend to the professor and sort the issue out. I'm sure Prof. Gash will resolve the issue within no time.

By the way, Prof. Gash encouraged the class to switch/change teams. He even gave the freedom to do it solo from what I can remember. So even if you are alone, you can do the assignment and get grades. Were you aware of it? Correct me if I'm wrong. Once again think before you post.
